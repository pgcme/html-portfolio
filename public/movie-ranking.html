<h1>Paula's Favourite TV Shows</h1>
<h2>My top 3 shows of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Parks & Rec</h3>
<p>American political satire mockumentary sitcom television series which follows the day-to-day activities of the Parks and Recreation Department in the fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana. Leslie Knope is one of my favourite characters of all times and I never grow tired of watching this show.</p>

<h3>Schitt's Creek</h3>
<p>Canadian television sitcom about love and humanity, told in an absolutely hilarious way. This is my comfort show. The series follows the filthy rich Rose family after they suddenly find themselves broke and are forced to rebuild their empire from a small town called Schitt's Creek. The show is so heart warming and funny that you come to understand and love the characters and their stories.</p>

<h3>Gilmore Girls</h3>
<p>American comedy-drama television series created by one of my favourites, Amy Sherman-Palladino, which follows the lives of Lorelai, a 32-year-old single mom, and Rory, her daughter, in the small town of Stars Hollow. The town has many witty and charming characters that support the Gilmore Gils through their ups and downs. Amy Sherman-Palladino also has another show that I really love called <b>"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"</b>.</p>
